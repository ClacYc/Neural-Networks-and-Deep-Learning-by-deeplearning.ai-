# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning-by-deeplearning.ai-
In this repo, I will upload the courses'  answers of 'deeplearning.ai' in Coursera by Andrew Ng.

My major in BUAA is computer vision(CV), so I just choose the DL course 1-4 excepting the course 5, which is not related to my major task. 

I hope I can deal with the course 1-4 in one month. Wish me luck!Feel free also to use this repo to your own work or learning. It will be a encoureging and meaningful thing if this repo can help you and I will be very delighted anout it.  
To be honest, I have watched most of Andrew Ng's courses from September to October(laugh), so the reason I am here is to deepen my understanding of DL through practice. 
In 2021/12/12 I finished the first programming assignment, I have to pick up the pace to complete the rest of the assignments! Wish me luck! I can handle it.
