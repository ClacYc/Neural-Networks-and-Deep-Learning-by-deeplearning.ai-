# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning-by-deeplearning.ai-
This repository is a simple record of Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course from Coursera by Pro. Andrew Ng .
To be precise, I am planning to post my own answer of each assignment on this warehouse everday, and I assume this is a relativly nice way to improve my understanding on Neural
Network and coding ability.
Besides, if these files can help you in some possible case, I would be happy for this. 
The strcuture of the Neural Networks and DL in Coursera as follows:
week 1 :Introduction of DL, which has no programming assignments.
week 2 :Neural Network basics
